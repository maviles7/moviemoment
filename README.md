# <MovieMoment>
A movie traking app. This was inspired by a friend you watched a little over 300 movies in 1 year who only used his notes app to track the movies and his thoughts on them. I'm also a somewhat avid user of Belli, an app that helps you track restuarants, and StoryGraph, an app that lets you track books. And, while eating and reading are two of my favorite hobbies, watching movies is probably my favorite hobby.

# Next Steps

- Next, I would like to add a favorites feature so that one could keep track of favorite movies.
- I would also like to work on a way to add friends so that you could track what your friends viewed and they reviewed.
